		<h1 class='text-center'>Creating links between alters</h1>
		<p>Here, we present an interface for creating edges or links between alters. On the next two screens, we show how to create links between alters. The first screen will focus on links based on closeness and the second will involve links based on professional ties. Network Canvas supports the creation of multiple types of links, which can be selectively shown or hidden from future sociogram interfaces.</p>
