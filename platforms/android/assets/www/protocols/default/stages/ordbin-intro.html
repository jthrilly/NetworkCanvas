		<h1 class='text-center'>Collecting ordinal &amp; categorical data</h1>
		<p class="">Network Canvas has also improved upon the process of collecting ordinal and categorical data quickly and effectively.</p>
		<p>The following interface allows respondents to quickly drag nodes into predefined bins, which we believe to be both efficient and low-burden relative to grid or matrix based approaches.<p>
		<p>The visual nature of the interface also allows reflection on previous choices, including the ability to subsequently re-allocate a node to a different bin. This has the potential to increase data quality.</p>
		<p>The number of bins, and the values that they assign as alter attributes, are all configurable parameters of this interface.</p>
