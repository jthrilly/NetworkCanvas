		<p class="">Integrating geospatial data has been extremely time consuming and difficult in networks research. Yet, many studies would benefit from its inclusion were it to be made practical.</p>
		<p>Network Canvas provides a wrapper over the powerful <code>leaflet.js</code> library, allowing researchers to import map tiles, shape files, and markers. Data produced by this interface can be assigned to an attribute of ego, or of their alters, and is then available to query in later interview stages.</p>
		<p>In this example, we use a custom map tile source, and load a world countries geojson shapefile. Network Canvas automatically makes the shapes toggleable.</p>
