		<h1 class='text-center'>Geospatial data</h1>
		<p class="">Integrating geospatial data has been extremely time consuming and difficult in networks research. Yet, many studies would benefit from its inclusion were it to be made practical.</p>
		<p>Network Canvas provides a wrapper over the powerful <code>leaflet.js</code> library, allowing researchers to import tile layers, geojson shape files, and markers. Data from this interface can be assigned as an attribute of ego, or of their alters, and is then available to query in later interview stages.</p>
		<p>In this example, we use a custom map tile source, and load a world countries geojson shapefile. Network Canvas automatically makes the shapes toggleable.</p>
