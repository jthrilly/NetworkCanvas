		<h1 class='text-center'>Qualitative network data</h1>
		<p class="">The following interface shows an experimental approach to qualitative network interviewing, which uses the data collected during the previous interview steps to create an interactive interview elicitation object.</p>
		<p>Designed to facilitate 'story telling', or simply open ended discussion, the narrative interface allows free annotation of the sociogram. It also allows for one or more alters to be selected, initiating a glowing effect (which can be cancelled using the reset button in the bottom left).</p>
		<p>In the upper right corner are a list of 'presets', which can display any combination of node attributes or edges. We have created two presets for this example, "education" and "contact".</p>
		<p>Annotations and node interaction data are stored in the interview log, along with a timestamp, meaning that it can be synchronised with an audio recording.</p>

				<h3>On the following screen, click on a node to toggle the glow effect. Click and drag anywhere else to annotate the screen. Use the preset panel in the upper right corner to change which attributes are shown on screen.</h3>
