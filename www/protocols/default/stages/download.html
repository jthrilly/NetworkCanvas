		<p>Network Canvas currently stores data in a JSON format that includes log and interaction data about the interview. It can be downloaded and viewed in a text editor.</p>

		<p>Data can also be exported to other social network formats. Here, we have implemented a GraphML export option, which produces files that can be viewed in most social network analysis programs (for example Gephi). </p>
