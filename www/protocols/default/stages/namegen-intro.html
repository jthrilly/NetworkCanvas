		<p class="">Name generators are a fundamental activity to be undertaken in almost all network interviews.</p>
		<p>In Network Canvas, name generators inherit the flexibility afforded by digital approaches. Data from external sources (rosters, previous interviews, CSV fies) can be brought in, and participants can edit any data they have provided seamlessly.<p>
		<p>Here, we use data collected in the previous step as an attribute of Ego, and create a custom control in the 'new alter' form.</p>

				<h3>On the following screen, use the "add node" button in the bottom right to create a new alter.</h3>
