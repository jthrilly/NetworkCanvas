		<h1 class='text-center'>Name generators in Network Canvas</h1>
		<p class="">Perhaps the most fundamental step in network interviews is having ego nominate  other people ("alters") based on some criteria. This step is referred to as a "name generator". </p>
		<p>Network Canvas can integrate many types of data into a name generator. For example, the interview designer can use a roster, or names nominated from a previous interview. <p>
		<p>In this name generator, we import two kinds of data to be used as alter attributes. The first is a list of roles (displayed on the next screen as  [set relationship roles]) and the second is a shortened list of groups based on the responses to the previous page.</p>
