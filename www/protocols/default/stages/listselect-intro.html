		<h1 class='text-center'>Selecting ego attributes</h1>
		<p class="">Our interview begins with a simple demonstration of an interface for collecting attribute data about ego. The data we collect here is stored as a property of ego in our underying network model, and can be queried and parsed by other interfaces.</p>
		<p>Later, we show how this attribute data can be dynamically pulled in to the interview in a different context (alter elicitation)</p>
